# Default Cake Images

This folder contains default images for each cake category. When a user chooses to use a default image instead of uploading their own, the system will use the image corresponding to the selected cake category.

## Image Naming Convention

The images should be named according to the cake category, with spaces replaced by underscores and all lowercase:

- `birthday_cakes.jpg`
- `wedding_cakes.jpg`
- `custom_cakes.jpg`
- `cupcakes.jpg`
- `eggless_cake.jpg`
- `chocolate_cakes.jpg`
- `fruit_cakes.jpg`
- `cheesecakes.jpg`

## Adding Images

1. Place your default cake images in this folder
2. Make sure they follow the naming convention above
3. Images should be in JPG format
4. Recommended size: 800x600 pixels or similar aspect ratio
5. Keep file sizes reasonable (under 500KB) for faster loading

If an image for a specific category is missing, a placeholder image will be shown instead.
